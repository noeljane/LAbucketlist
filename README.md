###Unsolved Problems & Next Steps

I wanted to make this app as a gift to a friend so I was hoping it would be very user-friendly so that she could really use it to track her work. 

**1. Password Reset **

I made several lengthy attempts at figuring this out using Michael Hartl's tutorial and the devise gem. None of it worked out. I need more in depth understanding of the rails framework and common practices. 


**2. Get user logged in automatically after creating an account **

This might be straight-forward but it was a project I didn't think about until the last day. 

**3.  Make it more beautiful **

Bootstrap is overwhelming. I didn't know where to start. 

**4. Add friendship as a feature**

It would be cool if you could invite your friends to do a bucket list with you or tag a friend who completed an item with you. 

**5. Add photo upload. **

This was a gem I had heard of but there were rumors it's not up to date and the documentation is sloppy

**6. Refactor Code to make it DRY**

There might be some superfluous code because I don't have good habits yet to keep my rails app super organized.
